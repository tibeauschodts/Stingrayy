Stingrayy is a NFT (non-fungible token) browser using the OpenSea API. The application is bootstrapped with CRA (create-react-app) and written in Typescript. 

**Here's a list of all technologies that were used and why:**

 - [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as the main framework
 - [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and the required types for better typing and quicker error handling
 - [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to send HTTP requests to the backend server
 - [Rbx](https://dfee.github.io/rbx/) as the UI framework (based on Bulma, written in TypeScript) to quickly build components for the application

**Extra information and documentation can be found in the code, you can also view a live demo of Stingrayy on [Heroku](https://stingrayy.herokuapp.com/).**
